# Urdu-Stemmer-Assignment
This is a simple **Urdu Stemmer** assignment of Natural Language Processing. 

Currently, I'm considering around 20 rules for stemming including sufixes and prefixes.

These rules can be seen in [source.py](/source.py) file.

Also, the **Accuracy Percentage** of the processing is also calculated at the end.
